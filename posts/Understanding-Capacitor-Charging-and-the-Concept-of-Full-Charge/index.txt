11:Tfa3,<p>While taking a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLww54WQ2wa5qVh1p8iPi7HspX7N9hbvbc&si=9h1KH2NZG2lSLsaB">course with Walid Issa</a>, we explored the fascinating behavior of capacitors. During one of the experiments, an interesting observation about capacitor charging sparked my curiosity. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-awad-36b481301/">Ahmad Awad</a> and I decided to dive deeper into the topic, conducting research that ultimately led to this blog.</p>
<p>When analyzing capacitors, we often hear that a capacitor is &quot;fully charged&quot; when the elapsed time equals 5 times the time constant (“5τ”). However, upon closer look, this statement needs some clarification. Let&#39;s dive into the theory, practical observations, and what &quot;fully charged&quot; really means.</p>
<h2 id="observations-from-the-simulation">Observations from the Simulation</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121022953.png" alt=""><br><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121023020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In a recent calculation, the capacitor was expected to be fully charged in 0.25 seconds. However, the voltage across the capacitor at this point was 11.923 V instead of the expected 12 V. The error was calculated as:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{12 - 11.923}{12} \times 100 = 0.6% $$ </p>
<p>This raised the question: Why is there an error when the capacitor is supposed to be fully charged at 5τ?</p>
<h2 id="the-truth-about-5τ">The Truth About 5τ</h2>
<p>The value of 5τ does not mean the capacitor is 100% charged. Instead, it means the capacitor has reached about 99.3% of its maximum voltage. Using the data from the simulation, we can confirm this:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{11.923}{12} \times 100 = 99.33% $$</p>
<p>This matches the theoretical prediction. While the capacitor seems nearly charged at 5τ, it never fully reaches 100% because of the exponential nature of its charging curve.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-explanation">Theoretical Explanation</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121015614.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The voltage across a charging capacitor is given by the equation:</p>
<p>$$ V(t) = V_{\text{max}} \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} \right) $$</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vmax is the maximum voltage the capacitor can charge to (12 V in this case).</li>
<li>t is the time elapsed.</li>
<li>RC is the time constant of the circuit.</li>
</ul>
<p>As time passes, $$e^{-t/RC}$$ gets closer to zero. </p>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121015737.png" alt=""><br>This means it would take infinite time for the capacitor to reach exactly Vmax. In practice, we consider the capacitor &quot;fully charged&quot; when it’s close enough to Vmax, such as 99.3% at 5τ.</p>
<h2 id="the-simulation-discrepancy">The Simulation Discrepancy</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121020039.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Interestingly, the simulation showed the capacitor reaching exactly 12 V, which seems to go against the theory. Why did this happen?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Oscilloscope Precision:</strong> Oscilloscopes show voltages with limited precision. If the capacitor voltage is extremely close to the maximum (e.g., 11.999999 V), the oscilloscope rounds it to 12 V.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding Effects:</strong> The actual voltage might still be slightly below 12 V, but the measuring device’s resolution hides these small differences. Higher-resolution equipment would show the tiny gap.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>At 5τ, a capacitor is 99.3% charged, not 100%.</li>
<li>It would take infinite time for a capacitor to reach exactly $Vmax$.</li>
<li>Simulations and measurements often show Vmax due to rounding and device limitations.</li>
<li>This approximation is fine for real-world use, as the difference is too small to matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these details gives a clearer picture of how capacitors behave and avoids common misunderstandings about what &quot;fully charged&quot; means.</p>
